# GopherJS Bindings for Googles ProtobufJS
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/johanbrandhorst/protobuf/jspb?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/johanbrandhorst/protobuf/jspb)

This package is based on the node package `google-protobuf`.
It has been "compiled" with webpack.

## Usage
The API is still experimental, and is not currently intended for general use outside
of via the [GopherJS protoc compiler plugin](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/protobuf/tree/master/protoc-gen-gopherjs).
See the [`protoc-gen-gopherjs` README](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/protobuf/tree/master/protoc-gen-gopherjs/README.md)
for more information on generating the interface.
